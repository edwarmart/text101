  storyText: "The large wooden doors creak as they swing on the ancient metal hinges,
    revealing the large, empty stone interior of the ancient temple. In the center, 
    you suddenly make out two pillars; one with a floating transparent crystal floating
    above it, and another of the same design but with nothing floating above.\r\nIt
    becomes apparent to you that you, at some point, must have walked between these
    two pillars because you have found yourself there. \r\n\r\n1. Choose the pillar
    with the transparent crystal floating above it.\r\n2. Choose the other pillar.\r\n3.
    Look Behind."
